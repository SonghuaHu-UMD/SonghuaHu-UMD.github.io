Hello! My name is Songhua Hu. Currently, I work as a graduate research assistant at the [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/), Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park. 
I received my B.S. degree in Transportation Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2016 and a M.S. degree in Transportation Engineering from Tongji University in 2019. My research interests focus on Big data and cloud computing, Smart cities and shared mobility, Statistics modeling and deep learning, Dynamic spatiotemporal network, and Integrated multi-modal traffic simulation. 

Research Interests
======
### Integrated multi-modal traffic simulation
I have six-years experiences in traffic simulation. 
I am experienced in Vissim, Synchro, TransCAD, and AnyLogic. 
I have leaded various micro and macro traffic simulation projects in different cities such as Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Suzhou, and Taiyuan. 
Currently, I am working on the development of an integrated multi-modal traffic simulation framework driven by the agent-based deep learning methods and the high-speed dynamic traffic assignment tools.

### Smart cities and shared mobility
I have one-year internship in EVCARD, the biggest carsharing program in China, as a data science to help support station placement and vehicle relocation. 
I have published several papers related to carsharing based on the data from EVCARD. 
I am now interested in comparing different shared mobility systems across the U.S., and the emerging shared micromobility like e-scooters. 
I am working with a team from Maryland Robotics Center to integrate the e-scooter into Vissim based on social force models.

### Dynamic spatiotemporal network
My Ph.D. career will mainly focus on the implement of network theory into human mobility. My current research efforts include three folds.
First, the visualization, quantification, and identification of dynamic human movement network; 
Second, the combination of Long Short Term Memory networks and graph convolutional networks (LSTM-GCN);
Third, the implement of cloud-based distributed spatiotemporal computing framework.
