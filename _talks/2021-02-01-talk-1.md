**Abstract**: A method combining sampling expansion with geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) was proposed to estimate the road network traffic volume with limited observation values. Firstly, a sampling expansion method based on spatial similarity was introduced to correct the imbalanced sample. Then, the GWPR was employed to estimate the hourly traffic volume of the lane considering the influence of the geometric characteristics of the road and the built environment. Results show that compared with the traditional linear regression and the geographically weighted Gaussian regression, the proposed combination model demonstrates the best estimation performance. In addition, the local spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between independent variables and traffic volume is also well captured.
